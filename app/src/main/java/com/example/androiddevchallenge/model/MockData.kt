I am a nervous young lady. My friends here at the shelter are looking for a savvy owner with mastiff experience who can help me continue to blossom. I need an experienced owner who will help me build my confidence with some obedience classes and give me plenty of exercise. I am starting to come out of my shell and make some doggy friends here. I'm very puppy like with my play and would benefit from a home with a confident canine companion. Once I have the time to warm up, my tail never stops wagging. If you are interested, please fill out an inquiry."

Being abandoned was the best thing that ever happen to him, because before that, the only life that he ever knew was an outside 10x10 kennel watching cars go by and being kept a couple hundred yards from the house that he never went in. Carter needs a home with no other animals or young kids, and he would really love a patient home to love him in his senior years. Being a part of a family will be something completely new to him, he will need help and guidance in learning what that is all about."

Lily was adopted out briefly, but suffered two seizures. We are unsure what caused them as she has not had any at the shelter. She has been to the vet and bloodwork came back normal so we are unsure what triggered the seizures. She has not had one at the shelter from what we have seen. She also has bad teeth, but will be receiving dental work.\nLily is getting older, and her hearing isn't as good. She is not fond of young kids and would do best with older kids that respect her space."

Dillon was probably never a family dog, so he would need love and patience to teach him what living in a home was like. He is dog selective, so a meet and greet is a must. We would probably say that he would like to be an only dog, as he has not liked the many dogs we have tried him with. Dillon does seem a bit reactive to kittiesaw well unfortunately. Dillon loves to hang out with kids who are respectful of him. He loves the 3 year old daughter of one of our volunteers!"

This cutie’s petite size and good manners make her a nice waking partner who won’t pull you around. Amala is asking for a home with no other pets. She just wants a couch & some cozy blankets to snuggle on, and of course unconditional love. Amala will be spayed before adoption.

I was kept outside and socialization was minimal at best. I am shy until I get to know you. I am looking for that special family that can allow me the opportunity to build a relationship with you even though it may be slowly. I prefer male dogs and would not do well living with other females. I am not sure how I am with kitties. I would like to learn the basics and hone my skills at leash walking. It would be great to have a home where I am a family member, loved, and cared for as I want to put my past behind and have a happy future."
