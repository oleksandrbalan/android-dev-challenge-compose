I need an experienced owner who will help me build my confidence with some obedience classes and give me plenty of exercise. I am starting to come out of my shell and make some doggy friends here. I'm very puppy like with my play and would benefit from a home with a confident canine companion. Once I have the time to warm up, my tail never stops wagging.
